                        <p> STEM-Level is a website all about helping you, as A-Level students, achieve the best possible grades in your STEM subjects- as our name may suggest. We believe that at the roots of achieving academic progression is <strong>love</strong> for what you are studying. If you can learn to <strong>love</strong> what you do, you're already halfway done with the process! The other half we shall help you understand with the content of this page. </p>

                            <h2> General Advice </h2>
                        <p><strong>Revision Techniques</strong> are widely varied and dependent on the person, subject, specific module, exam board etc. However, there are some universal techniques that should be considered for any subject.<p>
                        <p> - <strong>Spaced Repetition</strong> is the art of learning content by repeatedly testing your knowledge. Whether this is through making flashcards or doing mind-dumps (there are many other names for this; it is where you write out as much as you know about a topic, check how much you got correct, then write it all out again to hopefully get more correct) or any other way of actively revisiting content. Ideally you should learn everything before you start applying it to exam-style practice, so by constantly "relearning" everything, over time it will become infinitely easier to memorise.</p> 
                        <p> - <strong>Teaching Others</strong> seems to be a heavily underlooked technique. Your teachers' knowledge of the subject you are studying is far beyond yours, thanks to their years of experience and practice. You can follow in this path by taching someone what you are attempting to revise, i.e. a fellow classmate, friend, family member or even just recording yourself asking and answering questions. This way you can act as if you're participating in the classroom no matter where you are, which is of course the backbone of your education.</p> 
                        <p> - <strong>Exam Practice</strong> should go without saying. Your grade is completely determined by the last ever set of exams you do, so naturally you should be confidently completing past papers, practice papers, specimen papers etc. by the time you reach that point. For Maths and Further Maths specifically, you should be spending a very large majority of your revision time practicing and practicing. Most, if not all, Exam Boards will have some pattern in the way they ask questions. The earlier you begin doing exam questions the more time you will have to complete and repeat them; eventually you will recognise these patterns and find many difficult questions far easier. </p> 
                        <p>Some Resources you should utilise are: <strong>YouTube Channels</strong> i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@khanacademy" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor" target="_blank">Organic Chemistry Tutor</a>, <strong>Flashcard creators</strong> i.e. <a href="https://quizlet.com/gb" target="_blank">Quizlet</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/about" target="_blank">AnkiWeb</a> and <a href="https://gizmo.ai/" target="_blank">Gizmo</a>, <strong>School/College Resources</strong> if available can be so incredibly useful, specifically because they tend to be far more personalised and targeted towards what you are currently learning.</p>

                        <p> Maths is the most commonly chosen A-Level subject, and for good reason. It is a subject that compliments nearly every other, it will also (probably) be the easiest subject you take as long as you know how to properly study it. If you study any of Physics, Chemistry or Biology alongside Maths you will find some major topics overlap especially in <strong>Applied Maths </strong>i.e. Forces, Moments, Hypothesis tests and Linear Regression. Of course I could include Further Maths in this list but I assume the overlap there is self-explanatory. You will apply mathematics in so many concepts during your studies it'll almost become like another language to you.</p>
                        <p>
                            With other subjects you will probably spend much more time actually learning and understanding a concept before applyig that knowledge into exam practice. With pure maths, as long as you generally understand the fundamentals of Integration, Differentiation and Trigonometric Identities/Functions; you can just rinse and repeat hundreds of practice questions and you'll guarantee yourself 50% of your grade. Mechanics and Statistics is slightly more demanding of memorisation, especially with difficult Moments and Hypothesis Testing questions, but essentially the same applies. Further Maths is of course far more challenging as the topics tend to be tougher to grasp. But a heavy lean on Matrices, Vectors, Complex Numbers and Differential Equations will be of immense support as these cover the bulk of exam questions in the Pure section; within Mechanics and Statistics it'll be most worth your time studying Elastic Collisions in 1D and 2D, Impulse and Momentum, Circular Motion, Centres of Mass, Poisson and Geometric Distributions, Chi-squared tests and T/Z-Distributions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            50% probably won't suffice, though, so to fight for A and A* grades you'll need to utilise the environment you are in. There will likely be many students in your cohort, if not there's plenty on social media, that are experts at studying and are willing to help- this is of course in addition to the support you are entitled to by your teachers. You can fully reach your potential if you can confidently seek out help. The other side of available support is probably even more beneficial: <strong>the internet.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many websites that can offer you high quality revision material for free, but I would recommend <a href="https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/" target="_blank">Physics & Maths Tutor</a> as a go-to spot. There you can access all the exam practice you need: past papers, practice papers, written worksheets, cheatsheets and model solutions.

                        <h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>

                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p> Biology as an A-Level subject is often found by students to be one of (if not the most) intriguing and dynamic, exploring the phenomena of life around them, as well as that within them. It is usually picked up by those who would like to explore the processes of life and their interaction at the cell, organism, organ and environmental levels. There is a considerable overlap of Biology with other branches of science, mostly so with Chemistry, especially when it comes to the concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology which require a solid understanding of chemical reactions. In the same vein, if you pursue Psychology or Physical Education along with biology, you will understand how they interrelate at the level of human body systems, nervous systems, and genes.</p>
                        <p> To put it simply, biology is tough. Unlike in Maths, which is all about doing an abundance of practice questions until everything clicks, biology demands the mastery of an enormous range of concepts which then have to be used under different conditions. Be prepared to have to recollect all of: cells and their structures and functions, principles of heredity, ecological systems, evolution, and even the biochemistry of photosynthesis and respiration week after week. Consistently achieving good test results requires a proper understanding and an advanced approach to the subject. You must learn how to study without breaks, that is, very active revision, and break information down into its finest details so you can analyse the process of how you should build your answers.</p>
                        <p> Another priority should be proper exam technique. Understanding the exam format, the question types, the format of the answers, and the structure of the exam from the multiple-choice bouts through data interpretation sections to exhaustingly long essay parts is very important. Utilize old papers for this purpose and try to practice more how you would write clearly and simply about complex topics that have many biological processes in them. All the help you can get from your teachers, online materials, and study partners will be very beneficial; it is very easy to get burnt out in biology if you try to cram everything by yourself.</p>
                        <p> There are many websites that I would recommend students use as a staple in their studies, a certain bunch I would like to mention in particular are <a href="https://alevelbiology.co.uk/" target="_blank">A-Level Biology</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/hs-bio" target="_blank">Khan Academy High School Biology</a> <a href=""></a>  and <a href="https://senecalearning.com/en-GB/" target="_blank">Seneca Learning</a>, which can help teach you via quizzes, flashcards and revision notes.

                        <h2 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h2>

                        <p>
                            Chemistry is often regarded as the “central science” due to its crucial role in connecting the physical and biological sciences. As an A-Level subject, Chemistry will challenge you to think both logically and abstractly, making it a great complement to subjects like Biology, Physics, and even Maths. If you're studying Biology alongside Chemistry, you'll find significant overlap in biochemistry, such as understanding the structure of macromolecules and metabolic pathways. In Physics, you'll explore the atomic and molecular theories that underpin much of chemistry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chemistry A-Level is divided into three key areas: Physical, Organic, and Inorganic Chemistry. Success in Chemistry relies on a strong foundation in fundamental concepts such as atomic structure, bonding, thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and chemical equilibrium. Organic Chemistry is often seen as the most challenging section due to its requirement for memorization of various reactions and mechanisms. However, understanding the underlying principles and patterns in these reactions can make the subject more approachable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To achieve high grades, practice is essential. You must get comfortable with applying theoretical knowledge to practical situations and calculations. Regularly tackling past papers, using revision guides, and practicing calculation questions will solidify your understanding and improve your exam technique. Online resources like <a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/" target="_blank">chemguide</a> and <a href="https://www.a-levelchemistry.co.uk/" target="_blank">A-Level Chemistry</a> provide comprehensive notes and practice questions to help you master the content.
